// This file implements a simple Lisp interpreter. It is written using a technique
// called append-only programming: the programmer is permitted to append code to the
// file, but not to edit code once it has been appended.

// First, we know that we must have an evaluator which turns an abstract syntax tree
// into a result. For our simple Lisp dialect, assume that all results are integers.
// We do not yet know what the abstract syntax tree will look like, so leave it
// declared but undefined.
